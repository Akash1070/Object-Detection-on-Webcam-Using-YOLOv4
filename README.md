## Deployment
  1. import dependent libraries.
  2. clone darknet repo:!git clone https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet
  3. change makefile to have GPU, OPENCV and LIBSO enabled.
  4. make darknet (builds darknet so that you can then use the darknet.py file and have its dependencies)
  5. get the scaled yolov4 weights file that is pre-trained to detect 80 classes (objects) from shared google drive.
  6. import darknet functions to perform object detections
  7. get image ratios to convert bounding boxes to proper size.
  8. run model on darknet style image to get detections
  9. run test on person.jpg image that comes with repository.
  10.
